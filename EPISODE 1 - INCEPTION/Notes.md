# NAMASTE-REACT COURSE EPISODE-1 ðŸš€

## REACT INTRODUCTION :-

- React is a free and open-source JavaScript library for building interactive websites and user interfaces or front-end webpage components- such as forms along with fields like text areas and buttons.
- Since its release in 2013, React has been maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) along with a community of developers and companies.
- It is component-based. An example of a component could be a form or even just a form field or button on a website.
- In React, applications are completely built with components.
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to build single-page applications. React allows us to create reusable UI components.
- ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook's Jordan Walke to make user interfaces for both web and mobile systems.
- React was first used in 2011 on Facebook's newsfeed. In 2012, it was used on Instagram, and in 2013 it was made available to the public.
- React is best for applications that change their data quickly and dynamically. It can show the parts of the UI that are changing without
  re-rendering the whole page. This makes the user experience much faster.

## HOW DOES REACT WORK :-

- While building client-side apps, a team of Facebook developers realized that the DOM is slow (The Document Object Model- (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents.)
- It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
- So, to make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript.
- When a user interacts with react application, React updates the virtual DOM and then compares the vitual DOM with the actual DOM.- It makes the necessary changes to the actual DOM which are reflected in the UI.
- The virtual DOM is a lightweight tree that contains only the necessary information to render a UI.
- The virtual DOM is the javascript object that is made up of react elements.

## WHAT IS EMMET ?

It is designed to speed up the process of writing and editing the code by providing a set of shortcuts that can be quickly expandable to full code blocks.

## WHAT IS CDN ?

- Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of services that delivers the content to users.
- Both React and React DOM are available over CDN.
- So, Basically it speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.
- The primary purpose of CDN is to reduce the delay in communication created by a network's design.

## CROSSORIGIN ATTRIBUTE IN CDN LINKS :

- Crossorigin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an http header based mechanism that allows a serverv to indicate any crossorigin (domain or port)- other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
- Crossorigin attribute provides support for CORS.
- <script crossorigin src = "....."></script> This indiactes that the script should be loaded from a diff. origin.

## WHY REACT IS KNOWN AS 'REACT' ?

Beacuse it was designed to help developers "react" to changes in the state of an application by efficiently rendering and uploading
the UI in response to those changes.

## DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRAMEWORK AND LIBRARY :

- A framework is used for building and deploying an application quickly.
- When we use a framework, we can use resources to facilitate faster development and a greater user experience-
- A library is used to enhance the functionality of an application.
- Libraries provide developers predefined functions and classes to make their work easier and boost the development process.
